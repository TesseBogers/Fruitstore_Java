Write a console application that:
1. Shows a list of available product (together with their prices, be creative)
   - Use class 

2. At the bottom, have an input that takes only numbers. Think of try-catch and other error handling methods
   - Create while-loop with a try-catch inside, repeat code until a integer is given as input of user.

3. When I enter a number that is in the list of products, 
   ask me how many products I want and add them to a list of ordered products (my basket).
   - Select number, how? Switch? 

4. When I press q and hit enter in the product number entry, the program should stop asking for ne products and show an order total. 
Show the ordered products with their amount, the unit price and the line price in some sort of table. You can use tabs to achieve that.
Sort the basket descending: from the highest priced product to the lowest. 
At the bottom, also show the order total and count 21% VAT over all products.

Nice to haves:
1. In the product number field at the bottom of your screen: when I type S, redirect me to a sorting option field. Make it possible for me to sort the availalbe products which I can order by price, by number and by name, both ascending and descending.
